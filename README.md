Overlay
=======

This is my Portage overlay where I dump all of the packages I create or modify. If anything is out of date or doesn't build on your system, create a [new issue](../../issues/new) and attach a copy of the build log from a [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/).


Installation
------------

The easiest way to add this overlay to your Portage tree is through layman.

```
# layman -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynamotn/overlay/master/repositories.xml -f -a dynamo
```
